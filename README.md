# Divisional Secretariat Project Management

Introduction
This project aims to address the issue of ineffective utilization of government funds for city development. Each year, the government allocates a significant amount of money to develop cities, with the main control lying with the divisional secretaries. However, due to their inability to identify the primary development problems in the city, the allocated funds often go to waste on unnecessary projects. Some members of the divisional secretaries also engage in unwanted projects for personal gain, further hindering successful development.
To overcome these challenges, our solution focuses on effective customer and payment management. By incorporating customer feedback and streamlining the payment process, we can ensure the successful implementation of government-funded projects
